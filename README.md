## UUSphere
This is a personal project that allow students in UCSD to easily connect with others in the same building and classes. You can chat and interact with others in the same building or class.

I created this app because I saw students trying to find chat channels for their classes every quarter and I wanted to help them with it.

Shout out to [Edward](https://github.com/ewang2002), who provided the script to scrape all classes information from UCSD.

Serveice used:
1. Next.js
